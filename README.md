# Navigation-Stack-and-Sensor-Analysis
A navigation stack with real-time data acquisition to understand sensor characteristics and challenges in autonomous navigation. 

This project focuses on the characterization of sensor performance for Global Positioning System (GPS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and Magnetometer sensors. Custom Python drivers will be developed to facilitate data acquisition from these sensors.

Furthermore, the project aims to integrate these sensors into a unified navigation stack. This stack will employ sensor fusion techniques to combine the strengths of each sensor and mitigate their individual limitations. The performance of the sensor fusion navigation stack will be evaluated using real-time data collected during a designated trip. This evaluation will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the sensor fusion approach for real-world navigation applications.
